# musicManager – Basic Music Playlist Manager in C

`musicManager` is a command-line program built in C that allows users to manage musical playlists using linked lists. It supports operations such as adding, playing, searching, and deleting songs — all managed dynamically in memory. Each song includes an auto-generated ID, a name, and a fixed-length sequence of musical notes.

This project was developed at the **University of Guelph** to explore dynamic memory management and linked list data structures in a real-world context.
